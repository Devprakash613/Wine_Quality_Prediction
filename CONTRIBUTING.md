## Contributing To Wine_Quality_Prediction:
We are glad that you are interested in contributing to this repository!!
Below are some rules and we hope you enjoy contributing !

**Contributing Rules**
* Make changes only to the codeblock/cell pertaining to the issue. Do not make changes to the rest of the code.

**Contributing Process**
1. Fork this repository to your Github account. Once it is forked, follow the steps defined under "CloningJupyterNotebook.md" in this repository (as it is a slightly different process for ipynb files). You will also need to download the dataset so you can use it while running the notebook locally on your PC.

2. Run the downloaded ipynb file on Jupyter Notebooks, and make sure the dataset is in the same directory(on your local computer) as the notebook.

3. Head to the issues tab in the Github repository and look for the one you want to work with.

4. Issues marked "hacktoberfest" and "Help Needed" are a great place to start!!

5. Comment below the issue you are working on. For certain issues only a few PR's will be accepted(~3, also depends on the time elapsed), and the issue will be closed soon after. However, issues pertaining to making new models (ex: "Better Models?") will remain open for almost the entire duration of the event. Closing issues will be done at the discretion of the maintainer.

6. Now you can start working on the issue in the local copy of your ipynb file (as downloaded in step 1&2). Once done working on the issue, save and upload your local copy of the ipynb to your forked repository. 

7. Now navigate to the original repo (viz "acmpesuecc/Wine_Quality_Prediction"), and create a new Pull Request. Under the Comparing Changes section, ensure you are comparing ALL FORKS of the repo. Selecting your fork as the 'head' and the original one as the 'base', create a new Pull Request with a small description explaining what you have done. Ensure that the name of the ipynb in your forked repo is the SAME as the repo you are pushing to, and all other files are unchanged.
(Special note only for issue #8 ("Better Models?") :- You will be required to submit your code in a different ipynb file, hence would have to choose a different filename in the format MODEL/APPROACH_USED.ipynb. Ensure you retain all other files of the repo unchanged before submitting your PR)

8. Mention what Issue you have worked on. If the issue number is #3, you can mention "Closes #3" in the Pull Request description.

9. Submit your Pull Request. You PR will either i) be merged ii) be marked as Hacktober accepted, and you will gain bounty in both these cases, 
OR iii)changes will be proposed iv)if outside the submission window/ after issue has been closed, will be ignored in which case no bounty will be awarded.

Note: Please create separate Pull Requests for each issue. One PR closing multiple issues will NOT be encouraged.
